# AccountBalanceManager
Manage a user's bank account balances with GUI built with Kivy

The program pulls from a text file. However, it can easily be modified to pull from any storage system. The program only handles two accounts, 
'saving' and 'checking'.
To add more accounts, the UI would need to be modified with more text fields.
